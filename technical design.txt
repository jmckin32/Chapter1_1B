A simple 8 ball program that reads responses from a txt file

Made of a small loop that asks a question to the user, and then selects a random line from a txt file to then display to the user. If it detects the user inputs "quit", then it ends the loop.

Variables: the question being asked just to check if the user wants to quit; the list of responses

Functions: just the main
